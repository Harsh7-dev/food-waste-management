## **ðŸŽ¬ Demo Script Breakdown**

### **SECTION 1: Introduction (30 seconds)**

**Visual:** Show the application homepage
**Voiceover:** 
*"Hi! I'm [Your Name], and today I'm showcasing my Food Waste Management application built entirely on AWS Lambda for the hackathon. This project addresses a real-world problem: 40% of food in the US goes to waste, costing $218 billion annually. My serverless solution helps users track their food inventory and reduce waste through automated notifications."*

**Action:** 
- Show the main dashboard with analytics cards
- Point out the clean, modern interface

---

### **SECTION 2: User Authentication (25 seconds)**

**Visual:** Navigate to auth page
**Voiceover:**
*"Let me start by demonstrating the secure authentication system powered by AWS Lambda. Users can register with email validation and password strength requirements. The system uses JWT tokens for secure sessions and automatically subscribes users to email notifications."*

**Action:**
- Show registration form
- Demonstrate password validation (try weak password)
- Show successful login
- Point out JWT token in browser storage

---

### **SECTION 3: Adding Food Items (35 seconds)**

**Visual:** Add items to inventory
**Voiceover:**
*"Now let's add some food items to the inventory. Users can manually enter items or use the innovative barcode scanner feature. When you scan a product barcode, the app automatically fetches product information from the Open Food Facts API, making data entry effortless."*

**Action:**
- Add item manually (show form validation)
- Navigate to barcode scanner
- Scan a product (or use test mode)
- Show auto-filled product information
- Return to dashboard to see new item

---

### **SECTION 4: Analytics Dashboard (30 seconds)**

**Visual:** Show analytics and inventory
**Voiceover:**
*"The real-time analytics dashboard, powered by Lambda functions, provides instant insights into your food waste patterns. You can see total items, expiring soon, expired items, and waste percentage. The color-coded system makes it easy to identify urgent items."*

**Action:**
- Point to analytics cards
- Show inventory list with color-coded badges
- Demonstrate sorting by expiration date
- Show how analytics update in real-time

---

### **SECTION 5: AWS Lambda Features (40 seconds)**

**Visual:** Show backend architecture and notifications
**Voiceover:**
*"Here's how AWS Lambda powers this application. Every user action triggers Lambda functions through API Gateway. The system includes automated notifications - a scheduled Lambda function runs daily to scan for expiring items and sends email alerts via SNS. This is all serverless, meaning it auto-scales and requires zero maintenance."*

**Action:**
- Show browser console with API calls
- Demonstrate item deletion (show API response)
- Show notification toast messages
- Mention the daily scheduled Lambda

---

### **SECTION 6: Advanced Features (30 seconds)**

**Visual:** Show map and additional features
**Voiceover:**
*"The application also includes an interactive map to find nearby food banks, helping users donate excess food. The entire system is built on AWS services: Lambda for compute, DynamoDB for data, SNS for notifications, and S3 for hosting. This serverless architecture ensures high availability and cost-effectiveness."*

**Action:**
- Show Google Maps integration
- Point out food bank markers
- Show responsive design on different screen sizes
- Mention AWS services used

---

### **SECTION 7: Conclusion (20 seconds)**

**Visual:** Show architecture diagram or summary
**Voiceover:**
*"This Food Waste Management application demonstrates the power of AWS Lambda in solving real business problems. Through serverless architecture, automated workflows, and community-focused features, we've created a solution that reduces food waste while connecting communities. The system can scale to serve thousands of users while maintaining cost-effectiveness."*

**Action:**
- Show final dashboard
- Mention hackathon submission
- Thank viewers
